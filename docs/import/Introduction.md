### Motivation

Just last year, Canada has 1.6 million cases of food related imports to the country. These shipments are phyiscally impossible to check individually to determine the quality and validity of the reports about these shipment. Currently, most shipment that could potentially have faulty shipment that can endanger the food safety of Canadians are being imported into the country without any assessments about the shipment. To aid analysts and inspectors from manually checking the incoming shipments, we can create statistical models and data visualization in making quantitative decisions in rejecting/accepting shipment based on huge volume of past data.
The ASF assessment dashboard was designed to assist analysts and inspectors in deciding which shipment coming into the country as well as assisting in analysis of the trends that exist in millions of imports throughtout each year

### Analysts
Analysts can benefit from this application by using the data visualization feature. Instead of manually creating graphs on Excel or other graphing software. The application displays interactive graph that responds to filters that analysts can pick and choose to observe from dataset.
### Inspectors
Inspectors can quickly obtain reject/accept decisions used by the statistical model and quickly inspect the shipments that are flagged as suspicious by the model. Currently, many shipments are being flagged as accepted without justifiable evidence. Using these models, we can provide more logical and statistical sound explanation why certain shipment were rejected.
